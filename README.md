Detect Facial expressions in the Image

# Introduction

This project utilizes EfficientNet, a convolutional neural network architecture, for facial expression recognition. The goal is to accurately classify facial expressions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

# Algorithm Overview

**Data Preparation:**


The project utilizes a dataset of facial images with labeled expressions.

The images are preprocessed using standard transformations like random horizontal flipping and rotation for data augmentation.

**Model Architecture:**


The model architecture used is EfficientNet, a state-of-the-art CNN architecture known for its high efficiency and accuracy.

The pre-trained EfficientNet model is fine-tuned on the facial expression dataset to learn features relevant to expression recognition.

**Training:**


The model is trained using a training dataset, with the objective of minimizing a cross-entropy loss function.

Training is performed over multiple epochs, with batches of images processed in each epoch.

**Validation:**


After each training epoch, the model's performance is evaluated on a validation dataset to monitor its accuracy and generalization capability.

**Inference:**


Once trained, the model can be used to predict facial expressions on unseen images.

Inference involves passing an image through the trained model to obtain predicted probabilities for each expression class.
